Time::Piece::ISO version 0.04
=============================

This module subclasses Matt Seargent's Time::Piece module in order to change
its stringification and string comparison behavior to use the ISO 8601
format instead of localtime's ctime format. Although it does break the
backwards compatibility with the builtin localtime and gmtime functions that
Time::Piece offers, Time::Piece::ISO is designed to promote the more
standard ISO format as a new way of handling dates.

I decided to create this module for two simple reasons: First, default
support for the ISO 8601 date format seems to be the direction in which Perl
6 is heading. And second, the ISO 8601 format tends to be more widely
compatible with RDBMS date time column type formats.

0.10  2004-12-09T06:03:25
      - Possible backwards compatability change: Added override for
        Time::Piece's implementation of strptime to return a Time::Piece::ISO
        object and to default to the ISO 8601 format instead of the ctime
        format. Thanks to Dagfinn Ilmari Manns√•ker for the spot!
      - Switched to Test::More for tests.
